# Shopping List Application

This is a simple shopping list application that allows users to:
- Add items to the list.
- Mark items as purchased.
- Clear the entire list.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add items to the shopping list using an input field and the "Add" button (or by pressing Enter).
- **Mark as Purchased**: Clicking on any item in the list will toggle its purchased status (strikethrough effect).
- **Clear List**: Users can clear the entire shopping list with the "Clear List" button.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:
1. `index.html` - The main HTML file that defines the structure of the page.
2. `codechallenge.css` - The CSS file to style the shopping list and other elements.
3. `codechallenge.js` - The JavaScript file that handles the logic for adding, marking as purchased, and clearing items.

## How to Use

1. **Add an Item**:
   - Enter an item name in the input field and click the "Add" button (or press Enter) to add it to the list.
   
2. **Mark Item as Purchased**:
   - Click on any item in the list to toggle its purchased status (strikethrough).

3. **Clear List**:
   - Click the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and list items.
- **JavaScript**: For the interactive functionality (adding, marking, and clearing items).
